It will quickly catch you up to speed on how to contribute to the library, what the overall sprint will look like, as well as the recommended way to create your first PR!\n",

No matter how much experience you have with coding or the library, with the exploratory aspect of this sprint and it being documentation focused, much of the library's insides will be new to folks and prone to discovery so absolutely come in and try it out!"

To keep an ear out for when I stream either keep an eye on the discord, or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/TheZachMueller)."
